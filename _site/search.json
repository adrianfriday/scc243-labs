    "text": "The goal of today is to explore the ‘carbon footprint’ (related to embodied energy) of your own digital appliances and devices that you identified last week. Unlike direct energy use, the energy here is required at all stages of the manufacturing pipeline, so the carbon footprint relates to mining of raw materials, processing, transportation, manufacturing and all the other items that come together to make your products and get them in your hands.\n\n\nThe carbon footprint of each device is at best an estimate of the average or typical embodied energy, as the supply chains are very long and complex. They also differ between even similar products, and change over time (e.g. a market might source from different suppliers).\n\nYou may get differences in estimates, or only be able to get an estimate for a device that’s as similar as possible\nSometimes manufacturers and resellers will list the carbon footprint, there’s always questions we should ask about whether we can rely on the data - data can be old, contain errors, or it may be in their interest to ‘scope’ the estimate to make their products look good\nWe may have to start caring more about data quality, e.g. published peer reviews in reputable journals with ‘life cycle assessments’ (LCA) analysis are likely to be the most reliable sources (more on this in a later lecture)\n\nSince this is just a short lab task, approximate ‘ball park’ estimates are good enough to ‘get an idea’.\n\n\n\nTime available: 1 hour:\nMake sure you have an up to date copy of your coursework repo available (git clone or git pull as needed to ensure you are up to date with the server), as before. In the ‘week3’ folder create a new markdown document called username-week3-labnotes.md, where ‘username’ is of course your username!\n\nFor each photo that you used last week, put a subheading that describes it\nLook up the carbon footprint of the device’s manufacture\nAdd a table. Bring over the annual energy use of the device based on your use pattern. Add a column converting this to CO2e by multiplying by a conversion factor (take care with your units!). In UK you can assume the energy mix is 0.207074 KgCO2e1\nAdd a column with the carbon footprint for the device\nNow add a row comparing the use footprint with the embodied footprint. Multiply the use footprint by the number of years you keep the device to get the total direct energy for that many years of use; calculate the ‘footprint per year’ of manufacturing footprint.\nYou should add a row for 1, 3, 5 and 10 years. In reality, some devices have shorter lifespans than this, but many (e.g. TVs, ovens) could last much longer.\nAdd a subsection ## Reflections with a short paragraph on your thoughts on how the various assets compare with one another, especially reflecting on the use phase related energy against the manufacturing or embodied energy.\n\nDon’t forget to git add your new file, commit and push to the server at least at the end of the task.\n\n\n\n\nYou should have an appreciation of how the embodied energy varies with the appliances and devices you use most often\nYou should appreciate how embodied energy is amortised over the life of the device, and how this varies with longevity\nYou should see how use phase and embodied phase varies considerably across devices\nYou should be gaining some or enhancing your ‘carbon literacy’.\n\n\n\n\nHere are some useful digital resources to help.

    "text": "This is an absolute essential. Submission of all work, and evidence of your achievement, will be through a ‘portfolio submission’ via SCC’s gitlab instance https://scc-source.lancs.ac.uk (this will be private to you, so you must invite ‘@friday’ as a collaborator - please choose anything higher permission than ‘Guest’, e.g. ‘Developer’ otherwise I can’t see your files! ).\nTo set this up, go to https://scc-source.lancs.ac.uk and login to create an account if you don’t already have one.\n\nRead about the basics of version control\nYou may find this step by step tutorial also useful, if you haven’t used git from the Linux terminal before\n\nEssentially, the idea is that you ‘check out’ (normally) the latest version of a project from the server to your local machine. Work on the content (mainly markdown text files ending in ‘.md’ in this case). Add the new files and Commit your changes (with a helpful message explaining what you’ve done is a key thing). Then push a copy of your repo to the server with ‘git push’.\nThe great thing is, there’s a backed up version of not just your work, but each important step leading up to where you are now. This will be important for the overall assessment of your work.\nIt’ll take a while to ‘get comfy’ with how this works in practice. Although I think this is important general learning (to use git from the terminal). You might find it easier to use the built in git client in vscode.\nRepos can generally be public or private. You can invite collaborators to either. We’d ask that all your coursework remains private to avoid unwanted code sharing.\nCreate a repo and clone it to your file system. Download my template (ZIP), expand it, and copy the files and weekly subfolders into your folder you’ve ‘cloned’ from the server. You should have a structure where there is a folder for each week’s lab that’s committed and pushed to your scc-source account by the end of this lab.\n\ni.e. Your repo in this case should be private.\n\n\n\n\nYou must use either HTTPS or SSH based URLs for securely pushing/pulling your code. HTTPS is easier, since SSH would require that you generate a public/private key pair then upload your public key to gitlab as part of your profile.\nIt’s easier to generate a ‘personal access token’. You will need your token to have both read_repository and write_repository access rights.\n\nYou use a personal access token instead of a password. You’ll want to keep this somewhere safe for future use, as once created you can’t see it again. Don’t share it with anyone!\nThe good news is VS Code will remember your credentials for you. The git password cache will enable the password to be remembered from the terminal so you don’t have to enter your password or token every time you push/pull from the remote repo (git config --global credential.helper cache) from the shell.\n\n\n\n\ngenerate a public/private key pair then upload your public key to gitlab as part of your profile\nEnsure you understand how to use the SSH URIs (that start with git@ instead of HTTPS) with your key pair for cloning and pushing your repos from/to your gitlab repo."

For example, if you had a smart speaker that takes 5W all year round this would be:\n\n5×365×241000=43.8kWh\n\\frac{5 \\times 365 \\times 24}{1000} = 43.8kWh\n\n\ni.e. 365 days in a year by 24 hours per day to get total hours used, multiplied by the power demand in Watts to get Watt-hours\ndivide by 1000 to get kilowatt hours\n\n\nThe task should be time bounded, i.e. you should not spend much more than 40 minutes of concentrated time on this task. I would expect you to find and calculate the power for 3-5 assets in detail in this time.\nAdd a subsection ## Reflections with a short paragraph on your thoughts on how the various assets compare with one another. Which uses most energy, which uses least, how does this relate to use time or overall powered on time.\n\nDon’t forget to git add your new file, commit and push to the server at least at the end of the task.\n\n\n\nIf you want to go further, you could try to approximate:\n\nthe amount of energy used by network traffic arising from your use of the Internet\nadd a further paragraph to your reflections discussing how this compares to the direct energy use of your device\nhow does this compare to a typical washing machine, refrigerator or domestic oven with the use pattern found in your household?\n\nWe will not worry about the cloud computing data centres, AI workloads or other energy demands that might be triggered by your device use for now.\n\n\n\n\nYou should have an appreciation of the direct energy requirements of the devices you use most often\nYou should appreciate their relative energy requirements and how this relates to use\nHow the impact of time affects the cumulative energy requirement (i.e. amount over a year)\nYou should be increasing your energy literacy\n\n\n\n\nHere are some useful digital resources to help.

In the ‘week2’ folder create a new markdown document called username-week2-labnotes.md with your markdown editor of choice.\n\nFor each photo, and while you have time in the lab, put a subheading that describes it\nAdd a little detail on how often you use it and for how long (estimate hours per day, week and year)\nUsing your photos and the resources below, look up how much active power the device uses when in use and add this to a markdown table under the appropriate heading\nIf the device has a different power level when not in use (e.g. on standby or 0W if powered off when not in use), find out what this is and add it to the table\nFinally, add a row that calculates the number of kilowatt/hours (divide total in Watts by 1,000 and multiply by the number of hours of use) based on your estimate of use per day, week and year. For example, if you had a smart speaker that takes 5W all year round this would be:\n\n5×365×241000=43.8kWh\n\\frac{5 \\times 365 \\times 24}{1000} = 43.8kWh\n\n\ni.e. 365 days in a year by 24 hours per day to get total hours used, multiplied by the power demand in Watts to get Watt-hours\ndivide by 1000 to get kilowatt hours\n\n\nThe task should be time bounded, i.e. you should not spend much more than 40 minutes of concentrated time on this task. I would expect you to find and calculate the power for 3-5 assets in detail in this time.\nAdd a subsection ## Reflections with a short paragraph on your thoughts on how the various assets compare with one another. Which uses most energy, which uses least, how does this relate to use time or overall powered on time.\n\nDon’t forget to git add your new file, commit and push to the server at least at the end of the task."

    "text": "The goal of today is to learn how to take energy measurements associated with running specific software. We’ll be indirectly using the Intel RAPL energy reporting from the CPU in your lab machine. Note, this is specific to Intel processors, so will not work directly on anything else (e.g. a Mac with Apple Silicon, Google Chromebook etc.)\nIn short: I strongly recommend you do this on the lab machine, and not on your laptop.\n\n\nReally, we’re taking a snapshot of the energy use of the CPU from the time we start measuring to the time the task is complete.\n\nThis could catch any computation going on, not just your code, so we should aim for isolation, i.e. trying not to get data that’s confounded by other software and hardware running at the same time\nIdeally, recognise that the measurement framework may add additional overhead (hopefully in this case it should be relatively constant for all tests)\nUnderstanding how much is missed by what we are able to measure (for example, RAPL measures the CPU, but not the memory, I/O subsystems or anything else that makes up the total system energy)\nRepeatable and representative test selection. We should run tests more than once and take an average (arithmetic mean) and standard deviation. We should report each run and the average. I’d suggest running each test 5 times.\n\nNormally, test selection would involve picking representative use cases or data sets to ensure that data or interaction dependent behaviour is captured. In our case for this lab, we’re going to use a CPU stress testing framework to make the test development process simpler.\n\n\n\nTime available: 1 hour:\nMake sure you have an up to date copy of your coursework repo available (git clone or git pull as needed to ensure you are up to date with the server), as before.

There are a lot of options. In selecting your tests you really want a mixture of:\n\nduration (see --timeout)\nCPU intensity of workload (see --workload-load)\nnot too much that isn’t CPU (as that’s what we’re primarily measuring) (see --cpu) There are several examples in the stress-ng reference guide.\n\nIt’s easy to have a test that runs for too little, or too much time - so do a couple of test runs before taking your measurements.\nDownload this python script which we’ll use for energy reporting from Intel’s RAPL API. This is a python script and needs to be executable - you may need to change it’s file permissions (e.g. chmod u+x profiler.py in the terminal shell)\nIn your markdown report, add an introductory paragraph on what you plan to measure and your ‘method statement’ of how you’ve conducted your tests\nFor each test case, add a subsection with the goal of the test, the command line you’ve used and a table with the results.\nThe table should have the results of each test run, how much time it took and how many Joules of energy\nFinish the table with the average time taken and standard deviation. You could use a spreadsheet like excel, or a stats package like R (see getting started reference)\nFor each test case add a summary converting from Joules to Watts (e.g. using a converter, or by hand):\nRecall, the power P in watts (W) is equal to the energy E in joules (J), divided by the time period t in seconds (s) - take care with your units!!\nP=EtP = \\frac{E}{t}\nAdd a subsection called ## Reflections which summarises what you’ve found, and any personal observations on the number of Watt’s associated with the computations.
