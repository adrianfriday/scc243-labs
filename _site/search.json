    "text": "The goal of today is to explore the ‘carbon footprint’ (related to embodied energy) of your own digital appliances and devices that you identified last week. Unlike direct energy use, the energy here is required at all stages of the manufacturing pipeline, so the carbon footprint relates to mining of raw materials, processing, transportation, manufacturing and all the other items that come together to make your products and get them in your hands.\n\n\nThe carbon footprint of each device is at best an estimate of the average or typical embodied energy, as the supply chains are very long and complex. They also differ between even similar products, and change over time (e.g. a market might source from different suppliers).\n\nYou may get differences in estimates, or only be able to get an estimate for a device that’s as similar as possible\nSometimes manufacturers and resellers will list the carbon footprint, there’s always questions we should ask about whether we can rely on the data - data can be old, contain errors, or it may be in their interest to ‘scope’ the estimate to make their products look good\nWe may have to start caring more about data quality, e.g. published peer reviews in reputable journals with ‘life cycle assessments’ (LCA) analysis are likely to be the most reliable sources (more on this in a later lecture)\n\nSince this is just a short lab task, approximate ‘ball park’ estimates are good enough to ‘get an idea’.\n\n\n\nTime available: 1 hour:\nMake sure you have an up to date copy of your coursework repo available (git clone or git pull as needed to ensure you are up to date with the server), as before. In the ‘week3’ folder create a new markdown document called username-week3-labnotes.md, where ‘username’ is of course your username!\n\nFor each photo that you used last week, put a subheading that describes it\nLook up the carbon footprint of the device’s manufacture\nAdd a table. Bring over the annual energy use of the device based on your use pattern. Add a column converting this to CO2e by multiplying by a conversion factor (take care with your units!). In UK you can assume the energy mix is 0.207074 KgCO2e1\nAdd a column with the carbon footprint for the device\nNow add a row comparing the use footprint with the embodied footprint. Multiply the use footprint by the number of years you keep the device to get the total direct energy for that many years of use; calculate the ‘footprint per year’ of manufacturing footprint.\nYou should add a row for 1, 3, 5 and 10 years. In reality, some devices have shorter lifespans than this, but many (e.g. TVs, ovens) could last much longer.\nAdd a subsection ## Reflections with a short paragraph on your thoughts on how the various assets compare with one another, especially reflecting on the use phase related energy against the manufacturing or embodied energy.\n\nDon’t forget to git add your new file, commit and push to the server at least at the end of the task.\n\n\n\n\nYou should have an appreciation of how the embodied energy varies with the appliances and devices you use most often\nYou should appreciate how embodied energy is amortised over the life of the device, and how this varies with longevity\nYou should see how use phase and embodied phase varies considerably across devices\nYou should be gaining some or enhancing your ‘carbon literacy’.\n\n\n\n\nHere are some useful digital resources to help.

    "text": "This is an absolute essential. Submission of all work, and evidence of your achievement, will be through a ‘portfolio submission’ via SCC’s gitlab instance https://scc-source.lancs.ac.uk (this will be private to you, so you must invite ‘@friday’ as a collaborator - please choose anything higher permission than ‘Guest’, e.g. ‘Developer’ otherwise I can’t see your files! ).\nTo set this up, go to https://scc-source.lancs.ac.uk and login to create an account if you don’t already have one.\n\nRead about the basics of version control\nYou may find this step by step tutorial also useful, if you haven’t used git from the Linux terminal before\n\nEssentially, the idea is that you ‘check out’ (normally) the latest version of a project from the server to your local machine. Work on the content (mainly markdown text files ending in ‘.md’ in this case). Add the new files and Commit your changes (with a helpful message explaining what you’ve done is a key thing). Then push a copy of your repo to the server with ‘git push’.\nThe great thing is, there’s a backed up version of not just your work, but each important step leading up to where you are now. This will be important for the overall assessment of your work.\nIt’ll take a while to ‘get comfy’ with how this works in practice. Although I think this is important general learning (to use git from the terminal). You might find it easier to use the built in git client in vscode.\nRepos can generally be public or private. You can invite collaborators to either. We’d ask that all your coursework remains private to avoid unwanted code sharing.\nCreate a repo and clone it to your file system. Download my template (ZIP), expand it, and copy the files and weekly subfolders into your folder you’ve ‘cloned’ from the server. You should have a structure where there is a folder for each week’s lab that’s committed and pushed to your scc-source account by the end of this lab.\n\ni.e. Your repo in this case should be private.\n\n\n\n\nYou must use either HTTPS or SSH based URLs for securely pushing/pulling your code. HTTPS is easier, since SSH would require that you generate a public/private key pair then upload your public key to gitlab as part of your profile.\nIt’s easier to generate a ‘personal access token’. You will need your token to have both read_repository and write_repository access rights.\n\nYou use a personal access token instead of a password. You’ll want to keep this somewhere safe for future use, as once created you can’t see it again. Don’t share it with anyone!\nThe good news is VS Code will remember your credentials for you. The git password cache will enable the password to be remembered from the terminal so you don’t have to enter your password or token every time you push/pull from the remote repo (git config --global credential.helper cache) from the shell.\n\n\n\n\ngenerate a public/private key pair then upload your public key to gitlab as part of your profile\nEnsure you understand how to use the SSH URIs (that start with git@ instead of HTTPS) with your key pair for cloning and pushing your repos from/to your gitlab repo."

For example, if you had a smart speaker that takes 5W all year round this would be:\n\n5×365×241000=43.8kWh\n\\frac{5 \\times 365 \\times 24}{1000} = 43.8kWh\n\n\ni.e. 365 days in a year by 24 hours per day to get total hours used, multiplied by the power demand in Watts to get Watt-hours\ndivide by 1000 to get kilowatt hours\n\n\nThe task should be time bounded, i.e. you should not spend much more than 40 minutes of concentrated time on this task. I would expect you to find and calculate the power for 3-5 assets in detail in this time.\nAdd a subsection ## Reflections with a short paragraph on your thoughts on how the various assets compare with one another. Which uses most energy, which uses least, how does this relate to use time or overall powered on time.\n\nDon’t forget to git add your new file, commit and push to the server at least at the end of the task.\n\n\n\nIf you want to go further, you could try to approximate:\n\nthe amount of energy used by network traffic arising from your use of the Internet\nadd a further paragraph to your reflections discussing how this compares to the direct energy use of your device\nhow does this compare to a typical washing machine, refrigerator or domestic oven with the use pattern found in your household?\n\nWe will not worry about the cloud computing data centres, AI workloads or other energy demands that might be triggered by your device use for now.\n\n\n\n\nYou should have an appreciation of the direct energy requirements of the devices you use most often\nYou should appreciate their relative energy requirements and how this relates to use\nHow the impact of time affects the cumulative energy requirement (i.e. amount over a year)\nYou should be increasing your energy literacy\n\n\n\n\nHere are some useful digital resources to help.

We should run tests more than once and take an average (arithmetic mean) and standard deviation. We should report each run and the average.

This can be your evaluation of the evidence available, but should be backed up by evidence you have identified and evaluated.\nExample ideas (but not limited to) might be:\n\nShould we be worried by AI’s energy demand?\nWhat is driving growth in ICT and can it be stopped?\nWhat is the role of ICT in helping us integrate renewables?\nShould we trust climate change advice from a chatbot?\nDoes a footballer’s tweet use the same energy as a rocket?\nWhat is stopping my phone or PC lasting 10 years?\nCan ICT be sustainable?\n\nI very much expect you to come up with your own ideas. But a key aspect is that you can find enough sources of high quality material and evidence to support an argument in a podcast.\n\nYou should create week6-notes.md in your week6 folder. Add a heading # Research question. Provide your research question and a brief justification paragraph of why you think it will make an interesting podcast.\nAdd a heading # Supporting material. List links to sources you’ve identified which provide evidence for and against the central argument of your research question. Your goal is to provide a well reasoned and logical argument based on objective and rational analysis. Unsupported opinion, unevidenced rants, sales/ greenwash will not gain good marks!\nRemember to: add, commit and push any new files you’ve created.\n\n\n\nRecall that there are many different forms of evidence, and some sources can be trusted more than others. You should be clear what is trustworthy and what might be compromised by vested interests, political or business ideology; or are just unsubstantiated claims, deliberate misinformation, or clickbait.\n\nPeer reviewed and respectable papers are probably more trusted, but in some areas, it is also possible for a paper to be respected and respectable, and still come to false conclusions (especially in low quality or pay to publish journals) - note some papers have already been found in journals that were created by ChatGPT, and no one caught it! Authors can be biased (for example, if the author has something to gain from arguing a certain position) - consider who they work for, whether they have credibility, and whether they are likely independent and objective.\nGrey literature sources such as blogs and social media posts will be prevalent, take even greater care in taking the conclusions and argument at face value. Look closely and critically at their sources. Who are they, do they have appropriate knowledge and experience? From what you know about energy and GHG, do their numbers seem in a credible range, or even physically possible?\nGenerative AI results need to be looked at especially carefully (i.e. click through to the source of anything it links to and check how authoritative it is!)\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are webcams with microphones on several of the lab machines in B74 and B80 SAT that you can use for recording. The free/open source Audacity software is available for recording, editing and processing your audio files. The final output should be good quality mp3 (e.g. around 192Kbps or similar variable bitrate mp3).\nYou will likely find the lab environment too noisy for recording the final take of the audio. Most phones have reasonable quality voice recording software, or you can capture audio from your computer if you have a microphone.\n\n\nIf you are not comfortable recording your own voice, consider asking someone else not on the course who likes performing to read your script. You could also use text to speech, although this will likely negatively impact the final end product quality, unless it’s used sparingly or to make a particular point, e.g. voicing an argument from a machine point of view.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nConsider early in the process whether you want to record any interviews with anyone, e.g. experts on a particular topic.\n\n\nIf so, you will want to gain ethical approval that your methods are acceptable and leave time to schedule and record an interview, transcribe and summarise the results. Conversational podcasts with more than one speaker are normally more engaging.\n\nParticipant information sheet (to customise)\nEthics application form (to send to me by email) for approval\n\nEssentially, you just want to make it clear you’re going to record them for a podcast and include the audio in the podcast. Be clear that they can withdraw and have their audio removed if it is possible to do so. Be also clear whether they’re happy for the audio to be identifiable and for them to be identified (they might want to remain anonymous or have their words voiced by someone else or masked in some way). If there are limits, like they are happy for use as a coursework, but not in the public domain, then the participant information form is the place to do this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nYou should avoid including copyright content where possible.\nThere should be no more than 30% of the content from sources other than you! Any clips from other sources should be short, e.g. no more than one or two sentences and should not be edited together to form the bulk of the content.\n\n\nIf you do choose to incorporate short sections of copyright material to illustrate positions or points from other sources e.g. short audio clips from online podcasts or talks, then you should not put your podcast in the public domain. You should also clearly state that it contains copyright materials in the accompanying notes that you submit in week 10. If the content, e.g. sound track, is rights free or needs attribution, then you should also put this in your week10-notes.md markdown file.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe podcast task is about critical understanding of evidence for and against a particular position w.r.t. ICT sustainability\nYou will learn how to find and evaluate reliable data to argue your position\nWhat makes a reliable source\nHow to quickly skim read and evaluate a written argument concerning ICT and sustainability"
