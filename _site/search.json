    "text": "The goal of today is to explore some of the world’s digital data infrastructure, and specifically, wired and wireless network connections and data centres.\nTime available: 1 hour:\n\nSetup git as per these instructions - 10 minutes\nGet started with markdown, see how to use markdown - 10 minutes\nThis research task - ~30 minutes\nBy the end of the week, please add a further short markdown document ‘username-me.md’ to your week1 folder with no more than 200 words on i. how significant you think ICT is in terms of climate change (impacts, benefits); and ii. 3 things (bullets) on what you’d like to learn on this course - this is your quick thoughts so I understand where we’re coming from, not a referenced argument or essay!\nDon’t forget to add any files you create, commit and push your repo at the end of the lab\n\n\n\nYou should create a lab notebook file for today to keep track of:\n\ndigital resources you’ve found, service provider/owner and statistics (link or data centre capacities, and ideally maximum energy demand)\nYou can choose a location to explore, this could be Lancaster or where you’re from, or a city or location worldwide you’d like to visit - on the proviso that some digital infrastructure is included (i.e. it’d be easy to pick somewhere remote with no infrastructure, and this isn’t an excuse to do so!)\nYou can choose to focus on data centres, networks, wireless cell towers, or any other regional computational assets you can find. I would recommend focusing on exploring one of these in detail, but you could pick more than one if time allows.\nThe task should be time bounded, you should not spend much more than 30 minutes of concentrated time. I would expect you to find 3-5 assets in detail in this time.\n\n\n\n\n\nCall your lab notes something like ‘username-week1-labnotes.md’, where username is your login id (mine would be friday). Create it inside your week1 repository folder, i.e. the same folder as this file.\nAdd a title, sentence about what asset or assets and region you’ve chosen to focus on. Add a subsection for each asset type, e.g. ‘## Data centres in Manchester’. See how to use markdown for hints.\nFor each asset, add it’s title, a link (URL) to information about it (capacity, energy demand, owner) and the search engine/map you used to find it. I’d recommend a markdown table for each asset. If you want to screenshot or include graphical snapshots of interesting features you find, then please feel free. Save any images you link to from your markdown file into the same week1 folder. I’d recommend jpg or png file formats for images (i.e. common formats supported by github’s markdown renderer).\nAdd a subsection at the end called ‘Reflections’. Write a paragraph under this with your overall thoughts on what you’ve found and observed, and ideally whether it has surprised you or confirmed what you already knew. How sustainable do you think it is?\nRemember to ‘git add’ any files you create, including any image files (or they won’t be committed). You can check what’s tracked in your report by using 'git status' in the terminal. Commit and push your repo at the end of the task (as a minimum). You can commit more often than this should you wish or continue after the allocated lab time.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow much provision is there in the region?\nHow does provision vary and relate to geography (power, water, coast, built environment, roads, rail), and population?\nIs there duplicate provision (e.g. capacity owned by more than one operator but serving the same region)? How many operators are there?\nAre there different levels of service (scales of datacentre, network capacity, coverage and data rates) to different regions?\nDoes the digital infrastructure follow any other built infrastructures (road, rail, waterways, coasts)\nIf possible, has this changed over time? (e.g. what was there 3, 5, 10 years ago)?\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should have an appreciation of regional digital infrastructure\nYou should have a better understanding of the distribution and clustering of digital services with geography\nYou should appreciate the relationship between different digital services, population areas in relation to other non-digital infrastructures\n\n\n\n\nHere are some useful digital starting points.

    "text": "This is an absolute essential. Submission of all work, and evidence of your achievement, will be through a ‘portfolio submission’ via SCC’s gitlab instance https://scc-source.lancs.ac.uk (this will be private to you, so you must invite ‘@friday’ as a collaborator).\nTo set this up, go to https://scc-source.lancs.ac.uk and login to create an account if you don’t already have one.\n\nRead about the basics of version control\n\nEssentially, the idea is that you ‘check out’ (normally) the latest version of a project. Work on the content (mainly markdown text files ending in ‘.md’ in this case). Commit your changes (with a helpful message explaining what you’ve done is a key thing). Then push a copy of your repo to the server with ‘git push’.\nThe great thing is, there’s a backed up version of not just your work, but each important step leading up to where you are now. This will be important for the overall assessment of your work.\nIt’ll take a while to ‘get comfy’ with how this works in practice.\nRepos can generally be public or private. You can invite collaborators to either. We’d ask that all your coursework remains private to avoid unwanted code sharing.\nCreate a repo and clone it to your file system. Download my template (ZIP), expand it, and copy the files and weekly subfolders into your folder. You should have a structure where there is a folder for each week’s lab that’s committed and pushed to your scc-source account by the end of this lab.\n\ni.e. Your repo in this case should be private.\n\n\n\n\nYou must use either HTTPS or SSH based URLs for securely pushing/pulling your code. HTTPS is easier, since SSH would require that you generate a public/private key pair then upload your public key to gitlab as part of your profile.\nIt’s easier to generate a ‘personal access token’. You will need your token to have both read_repository and write_repository access rights.\n\nYou use a personal access token instead of a password. You’ll want to keep this somewhere safe for future use, as once created you can’t see it again. Don’t share it with anyone!\nThe good news is VS Code will remember your credentials for you. The git password cache will enable the password to be remembered from the terminal so you don’t have to enter your password or token every time you push/pull from the remote repo (git config --global credential.helper cache) from the shell.\n\n\n\n\ngenerate a public/private key pair then upload your public key to gitlab as part of your profile\nEnsure you understand how to use the SSH URIs (that start with git@ instead of HTTPS) with your key pair for cloning and pushing your repos from/to your gitlab repo."
