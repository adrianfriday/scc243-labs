# Week 9 worksheet

As you know, weeks 6-10 are to be used to produce **a 10 minute audio podcast** exploring interesting and contemporary *digital* sustainability research questions.  You should be moving to using the labs for editing your audio and getting help and opinions on whether the podcast you're putting together meets the required standard.

*Some of you are catching up as the deadline approaches, it's fine to use the labs to ask questions about past weeks' tasks.*

## Reminder on AI use policy
**Amber**: See [AI and academic practice framework](https://portal.lancaster.ac.uk/ask/study/developing-academic-skills/using-ai-in-your-learning-and-assessment/). *AI can be used to help you search for evidence sources and explore opinions on topics.*  **AI should not be used to generate the script or podcast audio**.

## Task 4: record and prepare the audio

You should have selected the topic of your podcast and found evidence for arguing your position.  You should have a script with an index of how you plan to present this as an informative and engaging podcast.  If you are planning to interview someone, having backing music, or find snippets of audio from other interviews and podcasts, this is the week to do it.

Today's goal is to create the audio assets for your podcast.

* Please take careful note of where you got your audio from (source, start/end times, copyright), and if there are any licensing restrictions on its use.
* Note: if you are doing your own interviews, then ensure you note any restrictions as to how the audio is used (does it need to be disguised using a filter to mask the speaker's voice - or do they need to be revoiced by an actor/you, can it be aired to other students this or next year, can it be made public)
* *You could also think about royalty free background, intro or outro music to incorporate.*  There is no need for a message from your sponsor :)

1. You should create `week9-notes.md` in your `week9` folder.

2. Take the podcast script from last week, copy it into your notes and add further notes for each audio clip you create, especially if taken from an external source or interview.
	
3. By the end you should have checked off each of the items in your 'shooting list' and have noted down how long each clip is.  You should have a good idea of what the total running time of your podcast will be by the end of the task.

4. I recommend storing the audio clips in your H drive or onedrive, and just adding links to them in your markdown document - this *will avoid you having large binary files in your git repository!*

5. Remember to: `add`, `commit` and `push` any new (non-audio) files you've created.

Note again: this is *your* framing of *your* podcast, and using one of the online gen AI podcast audio creation tools **is not acceptable** and is **academic malpractice**.

## Making a good recording

Audacity is a free open source tool that you can use to record and edit your audio.  There are also webcams with microphones in B74 and B80 you can use.

Keys to making good audio recordings:

1. make a test recording to ensure the volume levels are acceptable
2. pay particular attention to background noise from people, vehicles or airconditioners.  You will likely want to record out of hours in the lab with the aircon off, or in private outside the lab to ensure this.  This is hard to remove in post-production.
3. Overdriven audio (too loud) will 'clip' and sound distorted and be unpleasant to listen to.
4. Quiet audio can be amplified and 'normalised', but this will also raise the noise floor, so it's better to have a good recording in the first place.

## Learning outcomes
* The podcast task is about critical understanding of evidence for and against a particular position w.r.t. ICT sustainability
* You will learn how to find and evaluate reliable data to argue your position
* What makes a reliable source
* How to quickly skim read and evaluate a written argument concerning ICT and sustainability
