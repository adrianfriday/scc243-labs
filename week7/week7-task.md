# Week 7 worksheet

Weeks 6-10 are to be used to produce **a 10 minute audio podcast** exploring interesting and contemporary digital sustainability research questions.  You should use the labs to discuss your core research question, approach, critical selection of evidence and materials.  Plus to learn and practice using the audio editing and recording software (`Audacity`).

*Each week* has **a short written deliverable**, and a submission **is not complete** without all the minor deliverables.

## Task 2: identify and evaluate evidence

You should have selected the topic of your podcast.  If you're in any doubt about it, then please discuss with the staff in your lab.

Today's goal is to find evidence that lets you explore positions, identify quotes, figures or trends to expand on your argument.  This could either be claim and counter-claim, or narratives and debate that you've found in the literature.

1. You should create `week7-notes.md` in your `week7` folder.

2. Your goal today is to create an **annotated bibliography**, so start with this main markdown heading.  The annotated bibliography is a full reference citation for each source, or URL as appropriate.

3. Then you should add 3 things: 1. a sentence on why you've chosen it.  2. a sentence or two on why you trust it, clearly stating the criteria you've explored to evidence this trust.  Then 3. a third sentence on the threat to validity, i.e. is there any reason you don't trust it, or any limitation we should be concerned about.

4. Remember to: `add`, `commit` and `push` any new files you've created.

Note that just providing a series of links or references without the explanations suggested **is not acceptable**.  I would expect a mix of content sources, not just a list of links, with clear evidence that you've chosen thoughtfully and carefully.

### Tips:

[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk) is a valuable resource for looking up papers or particular authors.  You will also find lots of good material via [onesearch](https://onesearch.lancaster-university.uk).

To read a paper quickly, I recommend reading the abstract, skim reading the introduction, then paging through to the discussion and conclusions.  A well written abstract and conclusion should capture succinctly the contribution of the paper.  You may find good quotes to use in the 'findings sections' and the headings are sometimes informative as to the key messages.

You may find authoritative people appear in talks, sometimes on YouTube, interviewed in podcasts or on their research group's website.  It's worth looking them up - you may find some good audio you can take clips from.  *Don't forget to note down any copyright or license constraints.*

### What makes a good evidence source?
Reminder as we said last week, there are many different forms of evidence, and some sources can be trusted more than others.  You should be clear what is trustworthy and what might be compromised by vested interests, political or business ideology; or are just unsubstantiated claims, deliberate misinformation, or clickbait.

* **Peer reviewed** and respectable papers **in good journals** are probably more trusted, but in some areas, it is also possible for a paper to be respected and respectable, and still come to false conclusions (especially in low quality or pay to publish journals) - note some papers have already been found in journals that were created by ChatGPT, and no one caught it!  Authors can be biased (for example, if the author has something to gain from arguing a certain position) - consider who they work for, whether they have credibility, and whether they are likely independent and objective.

* **Grey literature** sources such as blogs and social media posts will be prevalent, take even greater care in taking the conclusions and argument at face value.  Look closely and critically at their sources.  Who are they, do they have appropriate knowledge and experience?  From what you know about energy and GHG, do their numbers seem in a credible range, or even physically possible?

* **Generative AI** results need to be looked at *especially carefully* (i.e. click through to the source of anything it links to and check how authoritative it is!)  Remember, that AI models *hallucinate confidently* even if they don't have much data!

## Learning outcomes
* The podcast task is about critical understanding of evidence for and against a particular position w.r.t. ICT sustainability
* You will learn how to find and evaluate reliable data to argue your position
* What makes a reliable source
* How to quickly skim read and evaluate a written argument concerning ICT and sustainability
