# Lab 1

## Submission checklist

- [ ] Ensure that you've created **a private** github repository (I recommend cloning my template: [https://github.com/adrianfriday/scc243-labs.git](https://github.com/adrianfriday/scc243-labs.git)) - and click '`use this template`'
- [ ] Go to the course moodle page, find the github repo submission form link, and submit the (https://) link to your repo (should look like `https://github.com/adrianfriday/scc243-labs.git`) ^[Where `adrianfriday` would obviously be *your github user*]
- [ ] From the github web interface, go to 'settings' then 'collaborators' and 'invite' (add people button) `a.friday@lancaster.ac.uk`

- [ ] Complete the task for today, ensure that you've added any documents you create to this folder [in markdown format](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/)
- [ ] Make sure you remember to 'git add' any new files you create
- [ ] `Git commit` and `push` your work to the repo, you can update this at any time
