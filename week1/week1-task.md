# Part 2: Week 1 worksheet
The goal of today is to explore some of the world's digital data infrastructure, and specifically, wired and wireless network connections and data centres.

Time available: 1 hour:

* Setup git as [per these instructions](git_repo_setup.md) - 10 minutes
* Get started with markdown, see [how to use markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org) - 10 minutes
* This research task - ~30 minutes
* **Don't forget to add any files you create, commit and push your repo at the end of the lab**

## Task
You should create a lab notebook file for today to keep track of:

1. digital resources you've found, service provider/owner and statistics (link or data centre capacities, and ideally maximum energy demand)
2. You can choose a location to explore, this could be Lancaster or where you're from, or a city or location worldwide you'd like to visit - *on the proviso that some digital infrastructure is included* (i.e. it'd be easy to pick somewhere remote with no infrastructure, and this isn't an excuse to do so!)
3. You can choose to focus on data centres, networks, wireless cell towers, or any other regional computational assets you can find.  I would recommend focusing on exploring one of these in detail, but you could pick more than one if time allows.
4. The task should be time bounded, you should not spend much more than 30 minutes of concentrated time.  I would expect you to find 3-5 assets in detail in this time.

## Written record
1. Call your lab notes something like '`username-week1-labnotes.md`', where `username` is your login id (mine would be ``friday``).  Create it inside your week1 repository folder, i.e. the same folder as this file.
2. Add a title, sentence about what asset or assets and region you've chosen to focus on.  Add a subsection for each asset type, e.g. '## Data centres in Manchester'.  See [how to use markdown for hints](https://www.markdownguide.org).
3. For each asset, add it's title, a link (URL) to information about it (capacity, energy demand, owner) **and** the search engine/map you used to find it.  *I'd recommend a markdown table for each asset.*  If you want to screenshot or include graphical snapshots of interesting features you find, then please feel free.  Save any images you link to from your markdown file into the same week1 folder.  I'd recommend `jpg` or `png` file formats for images (i.e. common formats supported by github's markdown renderer).
4. Add a subsection at the end called 'Reflections'.  Write a paragraph under this with your overall thoughts on what you've found and observed, and ideally whether it has surprised you or confirmed what you already knew.  How sustainable do you think it is?
5. Remember to 'git add' *any files you create*, including any image files (or they won't be committed).  You can check what's tracked in your report by using `'git status'` in the terminal.  Commit and push your repo at the end of the task (as a minimum).  *You can commit more often than this should you wish or continue after the allocated lab time.*

## Things to explore
1. How much provision is there in the region?
2. How does provision vary and relate to geography (power, water, coast, built environment, roads, rail), and population?
3. Is there duplicate provision (e.g. capacity owned by more than one operator but serving the same region)?  How many operators are there?
4. Are there different levels of service (scales of datacentre, network capacity, coverage and data rates) to different regions?
5. Does the digital infrastructure follow any other built infrastructures (road, rail, waterways, coasts)
6. If possible, has this changed over time? (e.g. what was there 3, 5, 10 years ago)?

## Learning outcomes
* You should have an appreciation of regional digital infrastructure
* You should have a better understanding of the distribution and clustering of digital services with geography
* You should appreciate the relationship between different digital services, population areas in relation to other non-digital infrastructures

## Starting points
Here are some useful digital starting points.  Don't be afraid to look for your own.  I'm definitely interested in what you find and how you find it, and also what you're thinking about it!
