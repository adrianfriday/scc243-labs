# scc243-labs
Weekly lab tasks for SCC.243

## Weekly tasks build up a portfolio of assessment

Each week there is:

1. a task to do in lab
2. sometimes I'll set a recommended essential reading
3. there may be additional tasks (such as short pieces of reflective writing, in blog post format, especially at the start and end of the course)

All the writing will be conducted in markdown (`.md` files) and submitted via a private git repository that is shared with the course convenor `(a.friday@lancaster.ac.uk)`.  This should be started in week 1.

The labs are anticipated to be as follows:

| 1 | Setup research task, github; opening reflective statement | [week1](week1) |
