# Week 8 worksheet

Weeks 6-10 are to be used to produce **a 10 minute audio podcast** exploring interesting and contemporary digital sustainability research questions.  You should use the labs to discuss any further reflections on your choice of core research question, and critically explore the evidence for and against that you've identified.

*Especially important is to clear up any concerns you may have as to whether the evidence is sufficiently good, and whether your annotated bibliography from last week, is ok.*

## Reminder on AI use policy
**Amber**: See [AI and academic practice framework](https://portal.lancaster.ac.uk/ask/study/developing-academic-skills/using-ai-in-your-learning-and-assessment/). *AI can be used to help you search for evidence sources and explore opinions on topics.*  **AI should not be used to generate the script or podcast audio**.

## Task 3: script your podcast

You should have selected the topic of your podcast and found evidence for arguing your position.  Please discuss as necessary any concerns about this with the staff in your lab.

Today's goal is create a script that structures your podcast and draws the links from the points you plan to make back to the evidence sources, and/ or sources of media you plan to incorporate (own recording, quote from source X, from recording Y from A time to B time).

**This is not an exercise in being able to use generative AI to create a podcast.** e.g. [descript](https://www.descript.com/tools/podcast-script-generator).

But, **do** think about the structure of your podcast.  Podcasts usually have a 'shape' or overall structure to them:

* [How to write a podcast script](https://www.descript.com/blog/article/podcast-script)
* [Some nice ideas in this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/podcasting/comments/qvxz3k/how_to_write_a_podcast_script_my_simple_outline/)

Your goal is to introduce your question in an engaging way, bring in the claims and counter claims to explore the issue, then close with a good point to end on.  *You could also think about royalty free background, intro or outro music to incorporate.*  There is no need for a message from your sponsor :)

1. You should create `week8-notes.md` in your `week8` folder.

2. Your goal today is to create a **podcast script**, so start with this main markdown heading.  It's not a verbatim text of what you plan to say, rather:

	* section headings for the key structural elements
	* a running order for what you plan to talk about, facts, quotes or media elements you plan to include
	* link outs to sources for each of these elements, noting any copyright issues
	
3. A 'shooting list' of any audio resources you need to record, interviews you need to conduct, or music items you need to identify

4. Remember to: `add`, `commit` and `push` any new files you've created.

Note again: this is *your* framing of *your* podcast, and using one of the online templates verbatim or gen AI script writing tools **is not acceptable** and is **academic malpractice**.

## Learning outcomes
* The podcast task is about critical understanding of evidence for and against a particular position w.r.t. ICT sustainability
* You will learn how to find and evaluate reliable data to argue your position
* What makes a reliable source
* How to quickly skim read and evaluate a written argument concerning ICT and sustainability
