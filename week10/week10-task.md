# Week 10 worksheet

As you know, weeks 6-10 are to be used to produce **a 10 minute audio podcast** exploring interesting and contemporary *digital* sustainability research questions.  You should use this lab to finalise everything, make any final edits and get help and opinions on whether the podcast you're putting together meets the required standard.

1. **You should make sure all your folders and markdown files for each week's task are finalised and checked in to your repo.**
2. A complete copy of your repo is submitted as a single ZIP file [via the moodle submission point](https://modules.lancaster.ac.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=2609120).
3. A copy of your final audio podcast [should be submitted via moodle also](https://modules.lancaster.ac.uk/mod/assign/view.php?id=2609114)

*Some of you are catching up as the deadline approaches, it's fine to use the labs to ask questions about past weeks' tasks.*

## Task 5: finalise audio, write reflective statement, submit

You should be basically done with your podcast.  Make any final edits to the audio asset and check you're happy with it.

1. You should create `podcast-notes.md` in your `week10` folder.

2. Add any important details that might prevent or guide us in assessing or publishing your podcast.  For example:

	* [ ] The podcast creates copyright materials and can't be published as is
	* [ ] The interviewees have/have not given consent for the recording to be published
	* [ ] I give permission that the podcast can be published as an example for other students on the course
	* [ ] I give permission that the podcast can be entered into the informal competition (judged by the course convenors)
	* [ ] I give permission that the podcast can be entered into the faculty competition
	* [ ] I give permission that the podcast can be published online and be public

3. I recommend storing the audio clips in your H drive or onedrive, and *you avoid having large binary files in your git repository!*

4. Add a `week10-reflections.md` file to the `week10` folder.  I'd recommend reading your reflective statement from week 1, then please write brief statements on the following so we can learn from you:

	* what I have learnt on the course
	* whether your attitudes to ICT and sustainability have changed in any way
	* anything you'd recommend we definitely keep for next year
	* anything you'd recommend we do differently in future years

5. Remember to: `add`, `commit` and `push` any new (non-audio) files you've created.

6. Sanity check that everything is complete across all lab weeks and verify that the markdown files are added to your repo on `scc-source`.  Take care to check each week against the task checklists to ensure each week *is complete*.


7. **Submit the podcast** and **the git repo** using the submission points provided **on moodle**.

## Learning outcomes
* The podcast task is about critical understanding of evidence for and against a particular position w.r.t. ICT sustainability
* How to edit and present a narrative argument around a sustainability topic
* How to utilise evidence to support this narrative
* Creative audio editing and how to create a compelling podcast
