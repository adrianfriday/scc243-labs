# Lab 10 - submit and write reflective statement

## Submission checklist

This is *a multi-step task* that contributes 50% of the coursework mark for SCC.243.

Your goal *by the end of the module* is to deliver the following:

- [ ] Week 6 - [select a research question](../week6/week6-task.md)
- [ ] Week 7 - [find and evaluate quality of evidence](week7-task.md)
- [ ] Week 8 - [develop podcast script](week8-task.md)
- [ ] Week 9 - [record podcast materials](week9-task.md)
- [ ] Week 10 - [editing and production](week10-task.md)

Each step **has a deliverable output** that needs to be submitted in markdown format **via your git repo**.  Today *we submit* the final deliverable, **an audio file in mp3 format** via moodle *with a description* in the repo containing any limitations.  **Plus a reflective statement in markdown format.**
