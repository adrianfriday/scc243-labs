# Week 3 worksheet
The goal of today is to explore the carbon footprint (related to embodied energy) of **your own** digital appliances and devices that you identified last week.  Unlike direct energy use, the energy here is required at stages of the manufacturing pipeline, so the carbon footprint relates to mining, transport, manufacturing and all the other items that come together to make your products.

## Cautionary note
The carbon footprint of each device is at best an estimate as the supply chains are *very long and complex*.

1. You may get differences in estimates, or only be able to get an estimate for a device that's as similar as possible
2. Sometimes manufacturers and resellers will list the carbon footprint, there's *always* questions we should ask about whether we can rely on the data
3. We may have to start caring more about data quality, e.g. published peer reviews in reputable journals with 'life cycle assessments' (LCA) analysis are likely to be the most reliable sources

Since this is just a short lab task, approximate 'ball park' estimates are good enough.

## Task

Time available: 1 hour:

Make sure you have an up to date copy of your coursework repo available (`git clone` or `git pull` as needed to ensure you are up to date with the server), as before.  In the '`week3`' folder create a new markdown document called `username-week3-labnotes.md`, where 'username' is of course *your username*!

1. For each photo that you used last week, put a subheading that describes it
2. Look up the carbon footprint of the device's manufacture
3. Add a table.  Bring over the annual energy use of the device based on your use pattern.  Add a column converting this to CO$_2$e by multiplying by a conversion factor (*take care with your units!*).  In UK you can assume the energy mix is **$0.207074 KgCO2_e$**^[Figure from 2023, Department for Energy Security and Net Zero.]
4. Add a column with the carbon footprint for the device
5. Now add a row comparing the use footprint with the embodied footprint.  Multiply the use footprint by the number of years you keep the device to get the total direct energy for that many years of use; calculate the 'footprint per year' of manufacturing footprint.
6. You should add a row for 1, 3, 5 and 10 years.  In reality, some devices have shorter lifespans than this, but many (e.g. TVs, ovens) could last much longer.
7. Add a subsection `## Reflections` with a short paragraph on your thoughts on how the various assets compare with one another, especially reflecting on the use phase related energy against the manufacturing or embodied energy.

Don't forget to `git add` your new file, `commit` and `push` to the server at least at the end of the task.

## Learning outcomes
* You should have an appreciation of how the embodied energy varies with the appliances and devices you use most often
* You should appreciate how embodied energy is amortised over the life of the device, and how this varies with longevity
* You should see how use phase and embodied phase varies considerably across devices
* You should be gaining some or enhancing your 'carbon literacy'.

## Starting points
Here are some useful digital resources to help.  As before, very interested in which ones (or others) you actually use.  Don't forget, these are starting points, I'm not guaranteeing their quality!  *You should always have an open and enquring mind when it comes to data sources!!*
