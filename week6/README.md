# Lab 6 - Research Podcast

## Submission checklist

This is *a multi-step task* that contributes 50% of the coursework mark for SCC.243.

Your goal *by the end of the module* is to deliver the following:

- [ ] Week 6 - [select a research question](week6-task.md)
- [ ] Week 7 - find and evaluate quality of evidence
- [ ] Week 8 - develop podcast script
- [ ] Week 9 - record podcast materials
- [ ] Week 10 - editing and production

Each step **has a deliverable output** that needs to be submitted in markdown format **via your git repo**.  The final deliverable is **an audio file in mp3 format** submitted via moodle with a description in the repo.
