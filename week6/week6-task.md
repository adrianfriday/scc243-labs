### Use of AI
**Amber**: See [AI and academic practice framework](https://portal.lancaster.ac.uk/ask/study/developing-academic-skills/using-ai-in-your-learning-and-assessment/). *AI can be used to help you search for evidence sources and explore opinions on topics.  AI **should not** be used to generate the script or podcast audio.  You should state clearly in a section in your reflective report for the podcast in week 10, how AI has been used.*  Take **great care**, as AI can easily hallucinate evidence and references *that don't in fact exist!*.  I highly recommend [this short online module](https://thebullshitmachines.com) on what LLMs can and can't do, it's really interesting, informative and thought provoking!
:::

Weeks 6-10 are to be used to produce **a 10 minute audio podcast** exploring interesting and contemporary digital sustainability research questions.  You should use the labs to discuss your core research question, approach, critical selection of evidence and materials.  Plus to learn and practice using the audio editing and recording software (`Audacity`).

*Each week* has **a short written deliverable**, and a submission **is not complete** without all the minor deliverables.

The final submission by week 10 is the audio podcast file via **a moodle submission point** *and* and description summarising what the podcast does, a list of recorded materials/ sources if any are included, any copyright implications that would prevent its wide publication/ reuse, and a `#Reflection` section on what you've learnt via the repo (`week10` folder).

## Task 1: select a research question

The topic of your podcast should explore a contemporary topic or question in ICT and sustainability.  This can be your evaluation of the evidence available, but should be *backed up by evidence* you have identified and evaluated.

Example ideas (but not limited to) might be:

1. Should we be worried by AI's energy demand?
2. What is driving growth in ICT and can it be stopped?
3. What is the role of ICT in helping us integrate renewables?
4. Should we trust climate change advice from a chatbot?
5. Does a footballer's tweet use the same energy as a rocket?
6. What is stopping my phone or PC lasting 10 years?
7. Can ICT be sustainable?

*I very much expect you to come up with your own ideas*.  But a key aspect is that you can find *enough sources* of **high quality** material and evidence to support an argument in a podcast.

1. You should create `week6-notes.md` in your `week6` folder.  Add a heading `# Research question`.  Provide your research question *and* a brief justification paragraph of why you think it will make an interesting podcast.
2. Add a heading `# Supporting material`.  List links to sources you've identified which provide evidence for and against the central argument of your research question.  Your goal is to provide a well reasoned and logical argument based on objective and rational analysis.  Unsupported opinion, unevidenced rants, sales/ greenwash will not gain good marks!
3. Remember to: `add`, `commit` and `push` any new files you've created.

### What makes a good evidence source?
Recall that there are many different forms of evidence, and some sources can be trusted more than others.  You should be clear what is trustworthy and what might be compromised by vested interests, political or business ideology; or are just unsubstantiated claims, deliberate misinformation, or clickbait.

* Peer reviewed and respectable papers are probably more trusted, but in some areas, it is also possible for a paper to be respected and respectable, and still come to false conclusions (especially in low quality or pay to publish journals) - note some papers have already been found in journals that were created by ChatGPT, and no one caught it!  Authors can be biased (for example, if the author has something to gain from arguing a certain position) - consider who they work for, whether they have credibility, and whether they are likely independent and objective.

* Grey literature sources such as blogs and social media posts will be prevalent, take even greater care in taking the conclusions and argument at face value.  Look closely and critically at their sources.  Who are they, do they have appropriate knowledge and experience?  From what you know about energy and GHG, do their numbers seem in a credible range, or even physically possible?

* Generative AI results need to be looked at especially carefully (i.e. click through to the source of anything it links to and check how authoritative it is!)

## Recording advice and interviews

There are webcams with microphones on several of the lab machines in B74 and B80 SAT that you can use for recording.  The free/open source `Audacity` software is available for recording, editing and processing your audio files.  The final output should be good quality mp3 (e.g. around 192Kbps or similar variable bitrate mp3).

You will likely find the lab environment too noisy for recording the final take of the audio.  Most phones have reasonable quality voice recording software, or you can capture audio from your computer if you have a microphone.

### Who to record

If you are *not* comfortable recording your own voice, consider asking someone else *not on the course* who likes performing to read your script.  You could also use text to speech, although this will likely negatively impact the final end product quality, unless it's used sparingly or to make a particular point, e.g. voicing an argument from a machine point of view.

### Interviews & ethics

:::{.callout-tip}
Consider early in the process whether you want *to record any interviews with anyone*, e.g. experts on a particular topic.
:::

If so, you will want to **gain ethical approval that your methods are acceptable** and leave time to schedule and record an interview, transcribe and summarise the results.  *Conversational podcasts with more than one speaker are normally more engaging.*

* [Participant information sheet](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/media/lancaster-university/content-assets/documents/research/research-services/ethics/FSTSampleParticipantInformationSheet(02May24).docx) (to customise)
* [Ethics application form](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/media/lancaster-university/content-assets/documents/research/research-services/ethics/FSTSampleConsentForm.docx) (to send to [me by email](mailto:a.friday@lancaster.ac.uk)) for approval

Essentially, you just want to make it clear you're going to record them for a podcast and include the audio in the podcast.  Be clear that they can withdraw and have their audio removed if it is possible to do so.  Be also clear whether they're happy for the audio to be identifiable and for them to be identified (they might want to remain anonymous or have their words voiced by someone else or masked in some way).  If there are limits, like they are happy for use as a coursework, but not in the public domain, then the participant information form is the place to do this.

### Copyright and amount of 'other' material

:::{.callout-warning}
You *should avoid* including copyright content where possible.

*There should be no more than 30% of the audio from sources other than you!  Any clips from other sources should be short, e.g. no more than one or two sentences and should not be edited together to form the bulk of the content.*
:::

If you *do* choose to incorporate short sections of copyright material to illustrate positions or points from other sources e.g. short audio clips from online podcasts or talks, then you should not put your podcast in the public domain.  You should also clearly state that it contains copyright materials in the accompanying notes that you submit in week 10.  If the content, e.g. sound track, is rights free or needs attribution, then you should also put this in your `week10-notes.md` markdown file.

## Learning outcomes
* The podcast task is about critical understanding of evidence for and against a particular position w.r.t. ICT sustainability
* You will learn how to find and evaluate reliable data to argue your position
* What makes a reliable source
* How to quickly skim read and evaluate a written argument concerning ICT and sustainability
