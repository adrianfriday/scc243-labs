# Week 6 worksheet

### Use of AI
**Amber**: See [AI and academic practice framework](https://portal.lancaster.ac.uk/ask/study/developing-academic-skills/using-ai-in-your-learning-and-assessment/). *AI can be used to help you search for evidence sources and explore opinions on topics.  AI should not be used to generate the script or podcast audio.  You should state clearly in a section in your reflective report for the podcast in week 10, how AI has been used.*  Take **great care**, as AI can easily hallucinate evidence and references *that don't in fact exist!*

Weeks 6-10 are to be used to produce **a 10 minute audio podcast** exploring interesting and contemporary digital sustainability research questions.  You should use the labs to discuss your core research question, approach, critical selection of evidence and materials.  Plus to learn and practice using the editing and recording software.

*Each week* has **a short written deliverable**, and a submission **is not complete** without all the minor deliverables.

The final submission by week 10 is the audio podcast file via **a moodle submission point** *and* and description summarising what the podcast does, a list of recorded materials/ sources if any are included, any copyright implications and a `#Reflection` section on what you've learnt via the repo (`week10` folder).

## Task 1: select a research question

The topic of your podcast should explore a contemporary topic in ICT.  This can be your evaluation of the evidence available, but should be backed up by evidence you have identified and evaluated.

Example ideas might be:

i. Should we be worried by AI's energy demand?
ii. What is driving growth in ICT?
iii. What is the role of ICT in helping us integrate renewables?
iv. Should we trust climate advice from a chatbot?
v. Does a footballer's tweet use the same energy as a rocket?
vi. What is stopping my phone or PC lasting 10 years?

I very much expect you to come up with your own ideas.  But a key aspect is that you can find enough sources of good material and evidence to support an argument in a podcast.

1. You should create `week6-notes.md` in your `week6` folder.  Add a heading `# Research question`.  Provide your research question and a brief justification paragraph of why you think it will make an interesting podcast.
2. Add a heading `# Supporting material`.  List links to sources you've identified which provide evidence for and against the central argument of your research question.  Your goal is to provide a well reasoned and logical argument based on objective and rational analysis.
3. Remember to: `add`, `commit` and `push` any new files.

### What makes a good source?
Recall that there are many different forms of evidence, and some sources can be trusted more than others.  You should be clear what is trustworthy and what might be compromised by vested interests, political or business; or are just unsubstantiated claims.

* Peer reviewed and respectable papers are probably more trusted, but in some areas, it is also possible for a paper to be respected and respectable, and still come to false conclusions, or be biased (for example, if the author has something to gain from arguing a certain position).

* Grey sources such as blogs and social media posts will be prevalent, take even greater care in taking the conclusions at face value.

* Generative AI results need to be looked at especially carefully (i.e. click through to the source of anything it links to and see how authoritative it is)

## Recording advice and interviews

There are webcams on several of the lab machines in B74 and B80 SAT that you can use for recording.  The free/open source `Audacity` software is available for recording, editing and processing your recording.

You will likely find the lab environment too noisy for recording the final take of the audio.  Most phone's have reasonable quality voice recording software, or you can capture audio from your computer.

### Who to record

If you are *not* comfortable recording your own voice, consider asking someone else not on the course who likes performing to read your script.  You could also use text to speech, although this will likely negatively impact the final end product quality, unless it's used sparingly.

### Interviews & ethics

:::{.callout-tip}
Consider early in the process whether you want *to record any interviews with anyone*, e.g. experts on a particular topic.
:::

If so, you will want to **gain ethical approval that your methods are acceptable** and leave time to schedule and record an interview, transcribe and summarise the results.  *Conversational podcasts with more than one speaker are normally more engaging.*

### Copyright implications

:::{.callout-warning}
You *should avoid* including copyright content where possible.

*There should be no more than 30% of the content from sources other than you!*
:::

If you *do* choose to incorporate short sections of copyright material to illustrate positions or points from other sources e.g. short audio clips from online podcasts or talks, then you should not put your podcast in the public domain.  You should also clearly state that it contains copyright materials in the accompanying notes that you submit in week 10.  If the content, e.g. sound track, is rights free or needs attribution, then you should also put this in your `week10-notes.md` markdown file.

## Learning outcomes
* The podcast task is about critical understanding of evidence for and against a particular position w.r.t. ICT sustainability
* You will learn how to find and evaluate reliable data to argue your position
* What makes a reliable source
* How to quickly skim read and evaluate a written argument concerning ICT and sustainability
